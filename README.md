# Purpose of this project
This is a school project from my fall 2022 semester. This project was developed to apply RSA, AES, and SHA256 encryption algorithms, for confidentiality purposes, for a sender then the decryption of the file for a receiver. Although there isn't much to it, it was fun to build and I learned a ton about cryptography while creating this project!

# Cryptographic Application
- Please refer to the `new-code` directories `README.md` for steps to correctly utilize this app. Thank you!
